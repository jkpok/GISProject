# Shortest distance:

At a glace along with the shortest path tool we can analyse that the closure of these 4 schools are merged into the schools nearest to the them which we will analyse the equity of access later on.

Note that the distance between Pioneer Primary School and Juying Primary School is only around 2.2km. The distance between Farreer Park Primary school and Stamford Primary School is only around 1.95km.

It's generally less than 3km between the close and the school that it's being merged into.

# Buffer:

From the map, we have a buffer zone with radius of 1km around the school that will be closed as we assume that it is the service area of the primary school. For the close down schools, we can analyse that these 4 schools will potentially impact 1770 residential buildings as shown in the map. With assumption of 10 units per level across 12 levels with 1 in 2 household having a child. In total, there will be

To further compliment our previous analysis with the Choropleth Map (shortest distance), we have used Voronoi polygons to identify difference between the **flying distance to validate our** Choropleth map analysis of the number of residential building serviced before and after the closure of the primary schools. We will now look into each of them shortly.

Before the 4 schools close down, we have identified 4 areas that will potentially changed due to the closure as that the voronoi shape cause the color density to be lighten.

After the closure the 4 schools, we can delineate that the shape of the voronoi shape have changed causing the color to tone down. One example is towards the south of Singapore, Stamford Primary School have been closed down which explains the shift in the voronoi being lighter. Causing the voronoi that serve both Cantonment Primary School and Farrer park Primary School density to be changed.

This analysis aligns with the insights we gained from the choropleth map whereby the hexagon for Stamford Primary School the south have tone down in the density XX the desnity of .... changed
