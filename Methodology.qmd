In order to narrow our focus on the possible roads that primary school students would utilize, we filtered and selected only the following road types: motorway, motorway_link, primary, primary_link, secondary, secondary_link, tertiary, tertiary_link, residential, trunk and trunk_link.

From the map layout above, we have selected an area which consist of a closed and a merge school along with other schools that is within the area. The arrows denote the direction of the traffic flow which we then proceeded to use for our network analysis.

To provide a better view of the network we have hidden the OSM layer and provide the sub-zone as the backdrop.

# Creating matrix table for accessibility map

In order to create the choropleth accessibility map of schools, we first needed to create a hexagon grid covering the whole island of Singapore. Centroids of these hexagons were then generated.

Next, we used the QNEAT3 plugin's "OD Matrix Layers as Table (m:n)" function with the following inputs: point locations of the schools, centroid layer, and roads layers. This was an extremely taxing calculation which lasted 3 hours each time we ran it, totaling to 6 hours spent just running the function as we ran it twice. The first time it was ran to find the distances from all centroids to all schools **before** the closure, and the second time was for the distances from all centroids to all schools **after** the closure
