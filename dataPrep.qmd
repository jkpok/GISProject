# Motivation of the Project

Singapore has long been regarded as a success story about a small island without natural resources turned world-class metropolis in one generation. However despite the boon we experienced, or perhaps because of it, the birthrate has been declining to the extent where schools have to be closed. Our team is incredibly concerned about the consequences of Singapore's low birthrate which thus, led us to assessing the impact of closures or mergers of education institutions on equity of access.

# Project Objective

To determine the impact of closures/merges of primary schools in Singapores from 2022 to 2025.
