The denser the color (dark red), the shorter the travel distance between the points in Singapore to their nearest Primary Schools. The map shows that the majority of Singapore Primary Schools are highly accessible. There are some areas that are completely white/ inaccessible such as the North-Western planning area of Lim Chu Kang and Western planning areas of Pioneer and Tuas. However, they are inconsequential as they are not residential but rather industrial areas thus it explains the inaccessibility.\nThe lighter the color (dark, the shorter the travel distance between the points in Singapore to their nearest Primary Schools.\nimpact of closures or mergers of education institutions on equity of access.

We will now look into each of them shortly.\n\nBefore the 4 schools close down, we have identified 4 areas that will potentially changed due to the closure as that the voronoi shape cause the color density to be lighten.\n\nAfter the closure the 4 schools, we can delineate that the shape of the voronoi shape have changed causing the color to tone down. One example is towards the south of Singapore, Stamford Primary School have been closed down which explains the shift in the voronoi being lighter. Causing the voronoi that serve both Cantonment Primary School and Farrer park Primary School density to be changed.\nThis analysis aligns with the insights we gained from the choropleth map whereby the hexagon for Stamford Primary School the south have tone down in the density XX the desnity of …. changed"
